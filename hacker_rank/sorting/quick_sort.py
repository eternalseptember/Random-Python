"""
Input Format:
The first line contains n (the size of ar).
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing ar
(the unsorted array). The first integer (corresponding to ar[0])
is your pivot element, p.

Output Format:
On a single line, print the partitioned numbers (i.e.: the elements
in left, then the elements in equal, and then the elements in right).
Each integer should be separated by a single space.
