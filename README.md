This is a folder for random, loose python files that are unrelated to any bigger projects.

Folder explanations: 
* "foobar" contains my answers to google [foo.bar](https://www.google.com/foobar/).
* "older_stuff" contains activities from following [this tutorial](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html).
* "other" contains things written for experimental, educational purposes only. Nothing is guaranteed to work or work properly.
