older_stuff folder contains activities from following this tutorial: http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html

hacker_rank folders contain answers I wanted to save for review purposes.

foobar folder contains my answers to google foo.bar.

"other" contains my personal, experimental attempts at reinventing the wheel.

Otherwise, these are random, loose python files that are basically unrelated to anything major.
